# Personal Website

## Overview

This is the repository for my personal website. The main technologies I use in this project are Next JS and Tailwind CSS (with shadcn ui components).

I am currently going through a personal website revamp; all of the new pages for the personal website are under the /new route to make sure the production site doesn't get affected until the full redesign is done.

## Bash Commands

- pnpm build: Build the project
- pnpm dev: Run a development server of the project

## Code Style

- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')

# Workflow

- Be sure to typecheck when you’re done making a series of code changes
