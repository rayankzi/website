# AI Agents and MCPs Fully Explained

<PostDateRenderer date="04/16/2025" />

Most developers have probably adopted some type of AI into their development workflow, likely in the form of LLMs like GPT-4o (for asking general questions) or Claude 3.7 Sonnet (for coding questions). However, in the last few months, a new type of AI has upended the industry known as **AI Agents**.

Many people have been throwing around terms like "AI agents", "Agentic AI", and "Agentic AI workflows", but I and many others like myself actually had no clue what an AI agent was and the difference between AI agents and the regular LLMs I was used to before.

So today, I'll be giving an in depth explanation of what AI agents are, their relation to LLMs like GPT and Claude, and their relation to MCPs, a newly developed protocol for AI agents.
