# AI Agents and MCPs

<PostDateRenderer date="04/27/2025" />

These are some notes I took on AI agents and MCPs for writing my blog post on them. Enjoy!

- AI agents - systems powered by AI that can autonomously complete tasks, make decisions, and adapt to new info
- They are proactive tools → they take steps to achieve a certain goal
- Ex. Travel AI Agent
  - Instead of suggesting flights, hotels, and places, it will book flights and hotels, and if anything unexpected occurs like flight cancellations, it’ll rebook
- Use different example in blog post
- 3 characteristics of AI agents
  - Autonomous
    - they can act independently within a given scope
  - Goal oriented
    - focused on completing a certain task/achieving certain outcome
    - they may specialize in one specific area
  - Environment Aware
    - they respond to data or events around them (online or physical)
    - they can also store memory/context
- How they work, four main technologies
  - Core AI model (LLM)
    - this is the agent’s brain, usually name brand LLM like GPT, Llama, Gemini, etc.
    - handles understanding in generative language, reasoning, and problem solving associated with agentic abilities
  - Tool Usage
    - could be APIs, databases, custom written software to achieve some specific task
    - they go beyond generating tasks, they can use tools you specify to complete them
    - agent might have access to calendar API they can use to create bookings
  - Memory
    - most agents have access to short term memory, but some also of long term memory
    - allows agents to track what they have done and allows agent to adjust and adapt behaviors
  - Feedback Loops
    - This allows agent to continuously monitor and analyze the behavior
    - if something fails, agent can attempt to try again, or agent can try multiple things and figure out which one works best
- these four technologies are coordinated by decision making framework (reinforcement learning or rule based logic) → framework uses the different components from above to guide an agent on how to achieve specific task
- Decision Making Framework
  - Starts by agent defining a goal or accepting one provided by the user
  - then breaks the goal down into smaller, more actionable tasks
    - LLM used for agent should be good at reasoning and structuring information, so vague instructions can lead to more actionable subtasks
  - the framework will then decide what tools to use or what actions it needs to take for each subtask
    - Ai might choose between searching the web, querying a database of things, or executing something predefined
    - LLMs which is a part of the agent will act as the central problem solver, as they generate outputs that guide the decision making process
    - Ex. agent will ask LLM how to check weather, LLM says use weather API, then agent will go to API and fetch real world data, analyze data and see if it works **(use different example for blog)**
  - Then there is the feedback loop
    - After executing an action for a subtask, the AI agent will evaluate whether it came closer to acheiving the main goal, if not, the agent will adjust its approach dynamically
    - The LLM can analyze the results of an action
    - For example, if the AI agent sends an email but gets an unexpected response, the LLM will interpret the reply and suggest the next best thing to do
    - the loop is act, evaluate, adjust → enables agent to refine its actions and try different approaches if the first ones didn’t work
  - now it needs to track what its’ done → Memory and Context Management
    - To make informed decisions, the agent has to track progress and context, like what has been done, what remains, and any external changes
    - LLMs can retrieve or update memory (ex. keeping track of completed tasks and intermediate results)
      - Ex. if agent is writing research paper, the LLM will remember what has already been written and ensure consistency in the tone and facts written in the report
  - Now there’s the aspect of prioritization and conflict resolution
    - The decision framework will prioritize tasks and resolve conflicts when multiple paths and goals compete
    - ex. if AI agent is booking a flight but there are budget constraints, the agent will weigh options to determine the most optimal one based on the guidelines given
    - LLMs can evaluate and rank options using reasoning
  - Finally, there is reinforcement learning integration
    - Many decision frameworks will include reinforcement learning to improve over time
    - the agent can get a reward signal when it successfully completes a task or achieves goals efficiently
    - while reinforcement learning optimizes decision making, LLMs can add flexibility by handling tasks where pre defined rules don’t apply (ex. the LLM can help agent explore creative solutions when standard response won’t work)
- MCP - Model Context Protocol - a protocol similar to REST is a standardized way for an AI agent to communicate with a set of tools
  - AI agents are really good when they are given access to tools like databases, Google Drive, searching, etc.
  - All of these tools were implemented in various different ways; there was no standardized way of doing this, making it difficult to integrate different things into the agent because it required custom integration/custom coding
- MCPs are a standardized protocol for AI agents so that tool providers can write the same type of code and make the same type of services to make it easy for you to integrate the tools into the AI agent,
- Many big companies have developed MCPs that you can integrate into your own AI agents like Notion, GitHub, Stripe, etc.
